Using the particle filter algorithm we attempt to localize a robot that moves in a horizontal line. The following State Space Model (SSM) was used:

*Transition model*:
$$p(z_t|z_{t-1})=\frac{1}{3}[N(z_t|z_{t-1},1)+N(z_t|z_{t-1}+1,1)+N(z_t|z_{t-1}+2,1)]$$

*Emission model*:
$$p(x_t|z_{t})=\frac{1}{3}[N(x_t|z_{t},1)+N(x_t|z_{t}+1,1)+N(x_t|z_{t}-1,1)]$$

*Initial model*:
$$p(z_1)=Uniform(0,100)$$

# Question 1

For $T=100$ time steps, states $z_{1:T}$ (robot location) were simulated using the initial and transition models, and observations $x_{1:T}$ (sensor readings) were simulated using the emission model. Using the observations, we identified the state using the particle filter algorithm with 100 particles.

# Question 2

Question 1 was repeated were standard deviation in the emission model was changed to 5 and then 50.

# Question 3

Question 1 was repeated without correction, i.e. importance weights were always equal to 1.
